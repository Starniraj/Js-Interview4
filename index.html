    <!-- What is a Temporal Dead Zone?
A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.
A block is a pair of braces ({...}) used to group multiple statements.
Initialization occurs when you assign an initial value to a variable.
console.log(x);
    var x = 6;
    console.log(x);

What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax    
The for loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. It is typically used to execute a block of code for certain number of times. Its syntax is:
for(initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to be executed
}

What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
undefined

It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value.
var demo;
alert(demo); //shows undefined
alert(typeof demo); //shows undefined

null

Whereas, null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.
var demo = null;
alert(demo); //shows null
alert(typeof demo); //shows object


what is Symbol?
ymbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined.

Write code to explain map and filter in arrays
map() method: It applies a given function on all the elements of the array and returns the updated array. It is the simpler and shorter code instead of a loop. 
arr = new Array(1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4);
for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    arr[i] *= 3;
}

filter() method: It filters the elements of the array that return false for the applied condition and returns the array which contains elements that satisfy the applied condition.
arr = new Array(1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4);
new_arr = {}
for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    if(arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
         new_arr.push(arr[i]);           
    }
}

Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code
A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
(function (parameters) {
    //body of the function
})(arguments); -->
